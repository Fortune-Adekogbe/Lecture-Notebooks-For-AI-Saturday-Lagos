You will see code samples like this throughout the course, in the slides and in these notes. It's important not to take this to mean that you should memorize these precise function calls, or even do anything other than just scan over them briefly. As a data scientist, you'll be dealing with hundreds of different libraries and APIs, and trying to commit them all to memory is not useful. Instead, what you need to develop is the ability to quickly find a library and function call that you need to accomplish some task. For example, even if you know nothing about the in this case, you want to download the content of some URL. You can type into Google something like \"Python download url content\" (I just picked this precise phrasing randomly, feel free to try some variants on this). The first result for my search is a Stack Overflow page: How do I download a file over HTTP using Python?. While the first response actually lists the urllib2 package (this was the more common library at one point, but the requests library provides a simpler interface that does things like automatically encode parameters to urls and other niceties), the requests library home page is a few responses down. And once you find the home page for that library, the very first example on the page shows how to use it for simple calls like the one above. You can look through documentation here, but like above, if you have a question about the requests library, you can likely use good for a direct answer there too. For instance, if you want to learn to use the POST command, you can Google something like \"python requests library post command\" and the searches will either bring you straight to the relevant requests documentation or to a Stack Overflow page."]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"f0NAszJOD8G3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["General advice about programming\n","\n","- You will find

Fortunately, a fair number of web-based data services you will use in practice employ something called REST (Representational State Transfer, but no one uses this term) APIs.  We won't go into detail about REST APIs, but there are a few main feature that are important for our purposes:\n","\n","1. You call REST APIs using standard HTTP commands: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT.  You will probably see GET and POST used most frequently.\n","2. REST servers don't store state.  This means that each time you issue a request, you need to include all relevant information like your account key, etc.\n","3. REST calls will usually return information in a nice format, typically JSON (more on this later).  The `requests` library will automatically parse it to return a Python dictionary with the relevant data.\n","\n","Let's see how to issue a REST request using the same method as before.  We'll here query my GitHub account to get information.

The call here is just a standard HTTP request: it requests the URL https://api.github.com/user passing our token as the parameter access_token. The response looks similar to our above response, except if we look closer we see that the \"Content-Type\" in the HTTP header is \"application/json\".
